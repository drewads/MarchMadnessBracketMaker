# MarchMadnessBracketMaker
This is a python script that outputs a full bracket for use making an NCAA March Madness bracket. This program selects game winners from the round of 64 all the way through the finals using pseudo random numbers weighted by team rank. It also randomly selects the final game score based off of 2018 NCAA team scoring statistics.

The script makes the most sense when you're filling out a bracket on a computer, but you can also do it on a phone. Please download and use the script!
